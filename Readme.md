###About

My take one simple [Finite State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), which is a simple automaton like the one sketched below:

Its purpose is straightforward: Determine whether a given string will is formed according to the grammar of the machine outline. 
For example in the picture`aaabc` is valid but `aaabbc` is not.

### ToDo

Read final state from transitions, and don't set it explicitly
